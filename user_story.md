# User Story

As a data scientist,
I want to develop a reliable machine learning model for classifying Titanic survival data,
So that I can accurately predict passenger survival and gain insights from the dataset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The model should achieve a minimum accuracy of 80% on the test set.
2. The model should have a minimum precision of 75% for both survival and non-survival classes.
3. The model should have a minimum recall of 75% for both survival and non-survival classes.
4. The model's F1-score should be at least 75% for both classes.
5. The model should use cross-validation during training to ensure robustness.
6. The entire process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation should be automated.

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Titanic Survival Prediction Model
Scenario: Train and validate the model
Given the Titanic dataset is loaded and preprocessed
When the model is trained using cross-validation
Then the model's cross-validation scores should meet the acceptance criteria
Scenario: Evaluate the model on the test set
Given the trained model and the test dataset
When the model predicts survival on the test set
Then the model's performance metrics should meet the acceptance criteria
Scenario: Save and load the model
Given a trained model that meets the acceptance criteria
When the model is saved to disk
And the model is loaded from disk
Then the loaded model should produce identical predictions to the original model
```
